Hello, guys! MAKS here. Welcome to my YouTube channel, MAKS The Coder. In this video, I’ll show you how I built a fully responsive Snake Fruit Game using `HTML5`, `CSS3`, and `JavaScript ES6`. The game works seamlessly across devices, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. Watch the entire development process, from coding the game to deploying it on Netlify!

✅ Created with semantic `HTML` elements for better `SEO` and accessibility.
